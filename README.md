# *System for Real-Time Event Transformation and Routing Description*
## *Capital One*
## *Short Project Description*
In todayâ€™s technical landscape, increasingly event-driven architectures (EDA) are being used to create systems built from decoupled software platforms. These systems often include a variety of software components, many of which may be built internally by a company like Capital One, or incorporate vendor products. Although these components may all use events as a common way to share information, they also follow different formats, and different levels of detail, and without careful consideration can result in one event-driven component inappropriately influencing how other components interact with data. We challenge the VCU student engineering team to build a real-time AWS cloud-based system for processing events that provide the ability to transform, aggregate, and decompose events that can be used to translate vendor-specific event schemas to match a common enterprise event schema library. This will likely require becoming experts on AWS services like DynamoDb, Lambda, EventBridge, Step Functions, and X-Ray.
